I copied this from https://github.com/dusty-phillips/rescript-react-intro/tree/11366930496cb70ede8591548a9d6d432516d50b by downloading a zip file. ...and then fiddled a bit. 

Had to 
> npm install --global yarn 
as a first step. 

Then, in a terminal
> yarn install (took a while!)
because "yarn start" said "react-scripts not found"

Still can't get the rescript-build to happen as part of the overall build or serve...
Let's not worry about that for now. 

PLAN: try to copy from MinReTurbo(2?) to get reprocessing installed
